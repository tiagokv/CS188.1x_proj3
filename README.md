Python Project for edX course CS188.1x (Artificial Intelligence) - Project 3: Markov Decision Process + Reinforcement Learning 

This is a project mainly developed by MIT for course CS188.1x. They have assignments which you have you implement certain parts
of the code.

This project uses Reinforcement Learning to solve some problems like the gridworld, robot crawler, and the pacman using Q-Learning.

You can execute the pacman using: pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent

If you want to learn how to execute all the capabilities, assign yourself in the CS188.1x course in edX and go to week 9.
